Django Introduction:
- A framework in Python for web development.
-Free and Open Source
-It provides clean,hassle-free and pragmatic design with less code.

Benefits :
1.Exceedingly Scalable.
2.Reassuingly Secure.
3.Rediculously Fast.
4.Fully loaded.
5.Incredibaly Versatile.


Concepts covered in Tutorial:
-Setting up Django.
-Create Database.
-Play around with URL's and Views.
-Add Bootstrap and CSS.

Pre-requisite for DJango:
-Install Python with latest version.
-Install IDE as per your preference.


Steps to get started:
1.Install a virtual environment[venv]
         Command Prompt navigate to plugins installed i.e, PIP
         $pip3 install virtualenv
         
         
2.Create a venv:[Command Prompt]
          $virtualenv -v python3 env
    where 'env' is the name of the virtualenv created inside the folder.
    
3.Activate the Virtualenv :
        $source env/bin/activate
 All the tools and plugins will be installed inside virtaulenv not the machine.
 
 Alternative to activate VirtualEnv:
 -Install a plugin or a wrapper : VIRTUALENVWRAPPER
       $pip install vortualenvwrapper-win
       $mkvirtualenv env
       $activate
       
       
Create a Project:
-Before starting with teh project there should always one main site and then the sub site.
-To create a project : $django-admin startproject project_name
      This consists of pre-loaded Files[init.py,settings.py,urls.py,wsgi.py,manage.py]
-manage.py -Acts as a communicator between terminal and Django,such as migration,acessing application and so on.
-__init__.py : It tells it is a python package and it is aempty file.
               The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages;
-setiings.py : Holds teh settings such as Apps.
-urls.py :It contains all the url's of the application.
-wsgi.py: It is used to deploy application on server.


Lets get started :
            Website[TestProjects]
       -App1  [POLLS] 
       -App2
       -App3
       
Create an App inside Project Folder: $cd ProjectName
                                     $python manage.py startapp POLLS
-POLLS site are created with the following :
        init.py -Same as master
        admin.py:Allows to add Admin settings
        apps.py:Configure Apps
        models.py: Database Layout
        tests.py:For testing
        views.py : Display the content of Application
        

DJango has Version Control [GIT] only for the Models.py i.e,Database.
To execute the POLL App : $python manage.py startserver POLLS
-It amy require migrations of the app to be applied hence you can use admin IP ADRESS
-Admin IP : 127.0.0.1:8000


Create A Database:models.py
POLLS  Application will have : 1.Question->Needs a TextBox
                                           Publish date
                                           Author
                               2.Choice : Choice Text-> TextBox
                                          Votes
                                          Link to every Question
      
Once the models.py is modified we need to migrate i.e Any changes in database Schema 
design It needs to be migrated in Base Website : TestProjects 
        $python manage.py makemigrations POLLS
        
        
        
        
Before this you need to include AppName in settings.py of TestProjects under 'INSTALLED APPS'      
Once you again execute the command : $python manage.py migrate
-'0001_initial.py' file is created  which is like GIT VCS .
       
Populating Databas:Representing Database
-Go to Shell : $ python manage.py shell
               >>import django
               >>django setup()      # Allows the admin side
               >>from POLLS.model import class_name
               >>Classname.objects.all()   # Retreive the latest records
               >>To add a record : q=Classname(var_name =value,var_name2=value)
               >>q.save()  # To save the records
               
               
Code :
>>import django
>>import django setup()
>>from POLLS.models import Questions,Choices
>>from django.utils import timezone    # To retreive the current date 

>>Questions.objects.all()    # Retreives all the records []
>>q=Questions(quest_text="name",pub_date=timezone.now())
>>q.save()

>>c=Questions.object.get(pk=1)   # Get the records
>>c.choices_set.create(choice_text="  Bob ",votes=0)   #Relate the choice to questions
>>c.save()

>> $ python manage.py runsserver

>> 127.0.0.1:8000
